# Clue Generator (`clue.html`)

Intersection Gen v4 helps you spin believable clues fast by pairing one true "Signal" with one flavorful "Noise" based on guild involvement.

## Workflow
1. **Select Guilds** – Click guild sigils in the grid to cycle through states: off, orange Noise, or green Signal. The generator always pulls from the sets you marked.
2. **Choose Modality** – Pick Physical, Social, or Arcane from the dropdown to bias the table toward the type of evidence you need.
3. **Generate** – Hit "Generate Data" to roll a paired clue. The hero header keeps portal/accent controls handy so you stay in the same palette as the rest of the suite.

## Output Card
- **Signal Block** – Displays the object/evidence with guild tag and label text so you immediately know who left the real clue.
- **Noise Block** – Provides the coating/context that points elsewhere; throw it at the players to keep investigations twisty.
- **Friction & Fail Cost** – Quick reminders of how hard the lead should be to crack and what happens if the crew bungles it. Great for improvising stakes on the fly.

## Tips
- Treat Noise entries as set dressing for interrogations or crime scenes; even when players go the wrong direction you still reinforce the world's logic.
- Combine with the Case Board by dragging the output text directly into nodes or using the same guild colors for quick visual cues.
- If you need bigger red herrings, mark multiple guilds as Noise and only one as Signal; the generator will still mix the results cleanly.
