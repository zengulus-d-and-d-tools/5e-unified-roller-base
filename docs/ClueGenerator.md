# Clue Generator (`clue.html`)

A logic puzzle generator for mystery scenarios, distinguishing between "Signal" (true clues) and "Noise" (red herrings).

## Usage

### Intersection Logic
- **Concept**: Generates clues based on Guild intersections or specific district activity.
- **Signal vs Noise**:
    - **Signal**: The core truth the players need to uncover.
    - **Noise**: Contextual information that adds flavor but isn't the solution.

### Interface
- Simple interface to generate batches of clues.
- Helps GMs quickly populate a mystery board without designing every red herring manually.
- Integrated with Ravnica guild themes.
