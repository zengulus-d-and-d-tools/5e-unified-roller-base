# Encounter Recipes (`encounters.html`)

Prep modular enemy packages, hazards, and rewards that you can drop into any session without spreadsheet juggling.

## Structure
- **Encounter Cards** – Each card tracks name, location, threat rating, involved factions, and tactical notes.
- **Enemy Blocks** – Record stat block shorthand (hp, ac, save DC, notable features) along with minion counts.
- **Hazard/Complication Slots** – Attach lair actions, environmental twists, or social complications to remind you what makes the scene unique.
- **Reward Tracker** – Log treasure parcels, intel payouts, or reputation adjustments tied to the encounter.

## Workflow
1. **Draft** – Create a new encounter card for each reusable setup (e.g., “Boros checkpoint,” “Golgarian rot farm”).
2. **Tune** – Adjust enemy counts, tactical plans, and complication clocks based on the party’s current tier.
3. **Deploy** – When the scene triggers, open the card to follow the plan; mark which enemies/factors were used and jot quick notes for the timeline.

## Tips
- Tag cards with guild or district names so filtering mid-session is painless.
- Store “escalation paths” in the hazard section (e.g., backup squads, magical failsafes).
- Export along with the rest of the unified store data before a new arc so you always have prep history.
