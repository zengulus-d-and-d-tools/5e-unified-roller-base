# Encounter Recipes (`encounters.html`)

One-page prep cards for modular encounters. Everything saves to the shared data store so you can mix, match, and reuse fights across arcs.

## Card Anatomy
- **Header** – Title plus tier tag (Routine → Cataclysmic). Inline select menus let you change location, objective, or tier without reopening the form.
- **Opposition & Hazards** – Freeform text blocks for enemy lists, environmental twists, scripted beats, and rewards/fallout. Use one textarea per concept to keep the card scannable mid-session.
- **Meta & Notes** – Tag fields (guild, district, keywords) and timestamp badges so you can filter later. A final notes box is perfect for scaling advice or "if/then" contingencies.

## Workflow
1. **Add Recipe** – Click `+ New Recipe` to open the inline form. Fill in core fields (tier, location, objective) and drop bullet lists into opposition/hazard/reward boxes.
2. **Filter & Search** – Use the search bar or tier filter to find the right prep packet moments before it goes live.
3. **Run the Scene** – Keep the card open while adjudicating. Update notes, rewards, or tags in place; everything auto-saves.

## Tips
- Keep hazards and beats in short phrases so they read at a glance next to your initiative tracker.
- Tag by guild plus district (e.g., `Boros: Precinct One`) so you can pivot easily when players detour.
- Export the store from the Tools Hub before a new chapter so you always have a library of proven encounters.
