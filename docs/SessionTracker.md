# Session Tracker (`gm.html`)

Standalone GM control deck for initiative, rolls, references, and loot.

## Tabs

- **Tracker**: combatant list, initiative order, round/turn controls.
- **Roller**: ad-hoc roll tools with modifiers, modes, and result log.
- **Ref & Loot**: condition reference, loot tools, presets, scratchpad, import/export.

## Storage

- Uses its own Local Storage key: `gmDashboardData`.
- Not part of shared `RTF_STORE` import/export.

## Tips

- Export presets before switching devices.
- Keep this open alongside Campaign Dashboard for fast HP/AC cross-reference.
