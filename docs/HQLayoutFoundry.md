# HQ Layout Foundry (`hq.html`)

Multi-floor headquarters planner backed by shared campaign data.

## Blueprint Workspace

- Drag/drop rooms on a snap grid (`1 square = 2 meters`).
- Add, rename, and delete floors.
- Track room count, downtime slot count, and resource bay count.
- Configure junior operative capacity (`Junior Ops`) per HQ.

## Room Detail Panel

- Room name, designation, width, height, notes.
- **Downtime Activities** slots with assignee support.
- **Resource Bays** with deployment notes/suggestions.
- Duplicate/delete selected rooms.

## Data + Sharing

- Saves to shared `RTF_STORE` (`hq`).
- JSON import/export for layout portability.
- Screenshot export for current floor capture.

## Tips

- Keep circulation lanes clear in high-traffic floors.
- Use floor separation by mission type if literal verticality is not needed.
- Keep room notes action-oriented (what this room enables at the table).
