# HQ Layout Foundry (`hq.html`)

Design Ravnica-ready headquarters layouts with multi-floor blueprints, downtime assignments, and resource staging.

## Blueprint Canvas
- **Drag-and-Drop Rooms** – Add custom chambers and drag them into place. Rooms snap to a glowing grid that represents 2‑meter squares.
- **Multi-Floor Tabs** – Switch between floors, sky docks, or sub-levels. Add, rename, or delete floors without touching other layouts.
- **Live Stats** – Counters show the total number of rooms, downtime slots, and resource bays across the entire HQ.

## Room Detail Panel
- **Dimensions & Type** – Adjust width/height in grid cells, assign a designation (Command, Logistics, Arcane, etc.), and leave narrative notes.
- **Downtime Slots** – Create named slots for downtime projects. Assignee fields pull from the Hub's player list so you can match slots to the same operatives tracking DP.
- **Resource Bays** – Stage requisitions for rapid deployment. Suggestions pull from the Requisition Vault item list.

## Collaboration Tools
- **Import/Export JSON** – Share an HQ schema between devices or teammates.
- **Screenshot Button** – Renders the active floor to a PNG with neon blueprint styling for easy sharing in Discord or VTT handouts.
- **Local/Store Sync** – Data lives in `RTF_STORE`, so the hub and other tools can reference the HQ state for fiction or mechanical hooks.
- **Theme Controls** – Use the 🎨 Accent picker and 🌌 background cycler to match the layout palette to your table's aesthetic.

## Tips
- Keep hallways at least 2 cells wide for griffon ingress or emergency golems.
- Duplicate rooms for mirrored wings, then tweak names/notes for narrative flavor.
- Use floors to represent different operational modes (Street Ops, Sky Patrol, Underbelly Safehouse) rather than literal levels if it helps storytelling.
