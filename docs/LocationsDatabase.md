# Locations Database (`locations.html`)

Lightweight CRM for districts, safehouses, and notable fronts. Uses the same card styling as the hub so you can browse locations during prep or play.

## Layout
- **Hero Header** – Portal link, accent/BG controls, and a `+ Add Location` button that reveals the inline form.
- **Location Form** – Name, district/guild select, description, and notes fields. Perfect for logging sensory cues, contacts, or mission hooks tied to the space.
- **Filter Bar** – Text search plus district dropdown. Filters update live so you can find "Precinct Four" locations or everything tagged `Dimir` instantly.
- **Location Cards** – Each entry shows the name, district, description, notes, and delete/edit options. All fields are editable in place and changes write straight to the shared store.

## Tips
- Mirror district names from the Mission Timeline tags so cross-referencing is painless.
- Store downtime hooks in the notes field ("Spend 1 DP here to reduce Heat") to remind players why a location matters.
- Export from the Tools Hub before big arcs so you can maintain a historical log of neighborhoods the party has touched.
