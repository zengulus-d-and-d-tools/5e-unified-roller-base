# Narrative Engine (`dm-screen.html`)

Improvisation console for urban play: prompts, hazards, NPC motivation, and quick references all inside one neon shell.

## Panels
- **The Street** – One-click Incident generator outputs a full dispatch: what’s happening, who’s involved, and immediate hooks.
- **Scene Texture** – Four micro-generators (Structure, Infrastructure, Debris, Atmosphere) for layering sensory details or complications onto any scene.
- **NPC Improvisation** – Produce Wants/Leverage combos for street contacts, rivals, or impromptu antagonists.
- **Clue Signatures** – Collapsible reference table listing telltale physical/social/arcane markers for each guild; great for tying investigations together.
- **Friction & Hazards** – Button pairs roll 2d6 hazards or 2d20 snags to escalate tension, with results piped into the output card.
- **Debrief Phase** – Generates broadsheet headlines for wrap-up scenes or foreshadowing.
- **Guild Jurisdictions** – Quick ref outlining which guild responds to what and the perks they might extend to the task force.

## Usage
- Toggle the hero action bar to adjust accent/BG so the screen matches your other tabs.
- Fire individual generators as needed; outputs persist until you refresh, so you can keep multiple prompts open while roleplaying.
- Pair hazard results with Encounter Recipes or the Mission Timeline to keep fallout synchronized.
