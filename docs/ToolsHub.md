# Tools Hub (`tools.html`)

Landing grid for the entire suite. Open it first to import/export the unified data store, tweak the accent palette, or hand players a jumping-off point.

## Layout
- **Hero Header** – Import/Export buttons live up top along with the accent picker and background cycler. Alt+Shift+Click the title to expose DM-only cards (Hub, GM deck, Clue tools, etc.).
- **Card Grid** – Responsive cards link to every HTML tool (player sheet, dashboards, HQ, timeline, etc.). Icons and short blurbs help the table pick the right door quickly.
- **Secret Panel** – DM-only cards are tagged with 🔒-red borders; once the secret mode is active they fade in with a light animation.

## Tips
- Always import campaign data here first—every tool reads from the same store, so one import primes the entire suite.
- Use the accent picker before a session so all other pages inherit the same neon colorway.
- Hide DM cards during open-table play so players only see approved utilities.
