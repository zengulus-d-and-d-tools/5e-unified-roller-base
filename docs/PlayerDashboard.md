# Player Dashboard (`player-dashboard.html`)

At-a-glance matrix of every agent’s frontline stats. Ideal for table displays or DM control rooms when you need AC/passives/HP without opening full sheets.

## Layout
- **Hero Actions** – Portal/Hub links, `+ Add Player`, and the standard accent/BG controls.
- **Player Grid** – Responsive cards show editable name, AC, Passive Perception, Save DC, and HP fields. Colors highlight standout values (e.g., high PP) or low HP.
- **Empty State** – When no agents exist, the dashboard nudges you to add one so you never stare at a blank grid mid-session.

## Tips
- Use the HP field for "Max / Current" to keep context, or track temp HP by appending `+` values.
- Pair this page with the Campaign Hub or HQ Layout Foundry—the shared `RTF_STORE` player list keeps downtime tracking consistent as long as you import once from the Tools Hub.
- Add NPC allies when you need to remember their saves or passives alongside the PCs.
