# Mission Timeline (`timeline.html`)

Session chronicle for beats, fallout, and rolling heat. Designed for quick capture mid-play—no doc editor required.

## Layout
- **Event Form** – Toggle the log form to add an operation title, focus/district, heat delta, tags, highlights, fallout, and follow-up notes. Everything saves directly into the unified store.
- **Filter Bar** – Live search plus dropdowns for focus and sort order (Newest, Oldest, Heat). Toggle Heat/Fallout-only or hide resolved entries when you want to focus on open threads.
- **Timeline List** – Cards display title, summary, tags, and Heat/Fallout chips. Use the resolved checkbox to flip between pending and resolved status without leaving the page.

## Usage Flow
1. **Prep** – Before session start, skim the previous beats via the Heat-only filter to remind the table what’s still hot.
2. **Live Logging** – Add events as they happen; tagging by guild or location makes the filter bar priceless later.
3. **Debrief** – After action, edit entries in place to mark rewards, note consequences, or flip the resolved status when fallout is handled.

## Tips
- Mirror the Campaign Hub’s Heat value manually or copy the delta text into the hub to keep both views synchronized.
- Use tags like `fallout`, `intel`, or `debt` so searching weeks later is trivial.
- Pair entries with Requisition or Encounter cards via consistent naming to reconstruct entire operations on demand.
- Hide resolved entries during prep to keep the timeline focused on active leads.
