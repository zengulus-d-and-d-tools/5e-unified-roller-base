# Mission Timeline (`timeline.html`)

Lightweight chronicle for your campaign beats. Track scenes, fallout, and looming consequences without diving into a doc editor.

## Layout
- **Beat Log** – Each entry records scene title, summary, involved factions, Heat/Fallout adjustments, and a quick status (open, resolved, fallout pending).
- **Heat Tracker** – Inline display mirrors the Campaign Hub, so you can see how the timeline is pushing the Task Force toward complications.
- **Notes Drawer** – Use the free-form notes area for debrief summaries, lessons learned, or NPC reactions.

## Usage Flow
1. **Start of Session** – Log the previous session’s fallout so you remember outstanding threats.
2. **During Play** – Add new beats as they happen. The interface is optimized for quick keyboard entry.
3. **After Action** – Tag beats as resolved or mark them for follow-up. Record any reward/penalty issued.

## Tips
- Prefix scene titles with episode numbers (e.g., `12.3 – Rooftop Pursuit`) so sorting stays chronological.
- Use the Heat/Fallout fields in parallel with the Hub to keep both GM and players honest about consequences.
- Export regularly from the portal to maintain a campaign log outside the browser.
