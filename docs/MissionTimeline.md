# Mission Timeline (`timeline.html`)

Session chronicle for beats, fallout, and rolling heat. Designed for quick capture mid-play—no doc editor required.

## Layout
- **Event Form** – Toggle the log form to add an operation title, focus/district, heat delta, tags, highlights, fallout, and follow-up notes. Everything saves directly into the unified store.
- **Filter Bar** – Live search plus dropdowns for focus and sort order (Newest, Oldest, Heat). Toggle Heat/Fallout-only or hide resolved entries when you want to focus on open threads.
- **Timeline List** – Cards display title, summary, tags, and Heat/Fallout chips. Use the resolved checkbox to flip between pending and resolved status without leaving the page.

## Usage Flow
1. **Prep** – Before session start, skim the previous beats via the Heat-only filter to remind the table what’s still hot.
2. **Live Logging** – Add events as they happen; tagging by guild or location makes the filter bar priceless later.
3. **Debrief** – After action, edit entries in place to mark rewards, note consequences, or flip the resolved status when fallout is handled.

## Multi-Case Workflow
- **Case Selector** – Pick the active investigation from the header dropdown to see only that case’s timeline.
- **Create & Rename** – Spin up a new case or rename the active one from the same header controls.
- **Delete with Care** – Removing a case deletes its timeline events, so archive anything important first.

## Tips
- Toggle **Auto-sync Heat** in the filter bar to automatically apply event Heat deltas to the Campaign Hub heat meter (clamped 0–6). Disable it if your table prefers manual control.
- Use tags like `fallout`, `intel`, or `debt` so searching weeks later is trivial.
- Pair entries with Requisition or Encounter cards via consistent naming to reconstruct entire operations on demand.
- Hide resolved entries during prep to keep the timeline focused on active leads.

## Cross-Links
- [Case Board](CaseBoard.md) (`board.html`) – Pull timeline events into event nodes so beats, fallout, and Heat-driving moments stay tied to the active investigation graph.
