# Campaign Hub (`hub.html`)

Between-session operations board for case prep, group reputation, heat, and downtime projects.

## Layout

- **Case Prep Template**: title/logline, groups in conflict, goal, clock, obstacles, set piece.
- **Reputation Grid**: one card per configured group with `-` / `+` controls (range `-2` to `+2`).
- **Heat Meter**: shared campaign heat with `-` / `+` controls (range `0` to `6`).
- **Player Roster**: per-player DP, project name/reward, and 4-segment project clock.

## Controls

- **Portal / Dashboard** links in header.
- **Export / Import** buttons call shared `RTF_STORE` export/import.
- **Grant +2 DP** and **Reset All** roster utilities.

## Tips

- Update reputation and heat right after major scenes to keep downstream tools aligned.
- Use short, outcome-focused project names so HQ downtime assignments stay readable.
- Treat the case prep block as your single-source briefing for the current active case.
