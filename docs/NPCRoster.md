# NPC Roster (`roster.html`)

Keeps allies, rivals, and informants organized with guild tags and leverage notes.

## Layout
- **Hero Header** – Portal link, standard accent/BG controls, plus a `+ Add NPC` button that slides down the capture form.
- **NPC Form** – Name, guild, wants, leverage, and notes fields. Use it to log motivations or what currency matters to them.
- **Filter Bar** – Search by name/text and filter by guild to slice the roster down to the exact contact you need.
- **Roster Cards** – Inline editable fields for every attribute, backed by the shared store for persistence. Delete buttons clean up after arcs.

## Tips
- Fill in "Wants" with actionable statements ("Needs Golgari reagents weekly") so leverage is obvious mid-session.
- Pair leverage entries with Requisition tags—if an NPC wants a thing, make sure it exists in the Vault queue.
- Track rival progression by appending short timeline markers ("Week 3: promoted to Precinct Captain") inside the notes box.
